# Machine-Learning-Projects

For an advanced Machine Learning course I completed 4 machine learning projects ranging from implementing simple supervised machine learning solutions such as KNNs to complicated CNN models such as SqueezeNet and AlexNet. The code for all 4 projects can be found in this repo. Each project has a `Report.pdf` file which outlines the content of each project in great detail. Below is a higher level decription of each of the 4 projects.

## 1. KNNs and Decision Trees
In this project we implemented a custom cross validation method in addition to applying two machine learning classifcation models, KNNs and Decision Trees. The two datasets used for this project were the [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) and [Clothing Fit](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation) datasets. Both models were evaluated on both datasets using using our custom cross validation method to provide us with an F1 score as a measure of model accuracy. 

## 2. Gradient Descent and NLP



## 3. CNN for MNIST dataset with 2 handwritten digits per image

## 4. SqueezeNet and other well-established CNNs
